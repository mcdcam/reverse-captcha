# [Reverse reCAPTCHA](https://mcdcam.github.io/reverse-captcha/)

Unlike a normal CAPTCHA designed to filter out robots, this one filters out _humans_!

In order to pass you must be a robot (or *insanely* fast at mental math). If you want to try actually solving the problems, you can modify the timer `duration` in the state of the `Captcha` class.

Made with React + Popper.js (warning: first time I've used these).
